# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive testing system for LogistiX that covers all features listed in the FEATURES_OVERVIEW.md document. The system will include both backend API testing and frontend testing using Puppeteer to ensure complete functionality coverage, precise error detection, and proactive bug prevention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive backend API testing for all LogistiX features, so that I can detect API failures and data integrity issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL validate the response structure, status codes, and data integrity
2. WHEN authentication endpoints are tested THEN the system SHALL verify secure session management, password hashing, and CSRF protection
3. WHEN CRUD operations are tested THEN the system SHALL validate data persistence, relationships, and business logic constraints
4. WHEN market analysis APIs are tested THEN the system SHALL verify Vinted integration, data synchronization, and external API error handling
5. WHEN database operations are tested THEN the system SHALL validate transaction integrity, migration success, and data consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive frontend testing using Puppeteer for all user interfaces, so that I can detect UI failures and user workflow issues automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authentication flows are tested THEN the system SHALL verify login/logout functionality, session persistence, and redirect behavior
2. WHEN parcel management UI is tested THEN the system SHALL validate CRUD operations, form submissions, and data display accuracy
3. WHEN product management UI is tested THEN the system SHALL verify product creation, sales tracking, and financial calculations
4. WHEN dashboard functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL validate widget rendering, data visualization, and interactive elements
5. WHEN market analysis UI is tested THEN the system SHALL verify search functionality, data visualization, and external integration displays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want precise error detection and reporting, so that I can quickly identify the exact location and cause of any failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with specific component, function, and line number information
2. WHEN API tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture request/response data, headers, and database state for debugging
3. WHEN UI tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots, DOM state, console logs, and network activity
4. WHEN integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide context about external service states and data flow
5. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL report specific metrics and bottleneck locations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proactive bug detection capabilities, so that I can prevent issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL detect potential race conditions, memory leaks, and performance degradation
2. WHEN data validation occurs THEN the system SHALL identify edge cases, boundary conditions, and invalid state scenarios
3. WHEN external integrations are tested THEN the system SHALL simulate failure scenarios and validate error handling
4. WHEN security tests run THEN the system SHALL detect vulnerabilities, injection attempts, and authentication bypasses
5. WHEN load testing occurs THEN the system SHALL identify scalability limits and resource constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution and reporting, so that I can maintain continuous quality assurance without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger relevant test suites
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with pass/fail status, coverage metrics, and performance data
3. WHEN critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications with detailed failure information
4. WHEN test suites run THEN the system SHALL execute in parallel to minimize execution time
5. WHEN test results are available THEN the system SHALL integrate with CI/CD pipelines and development workflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want feature-specific test coverage for all LogistiX functionalities, so that every component is thoroughly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication features are tested THEN the system SHALL cover login, logout, profile management, security, and session handling
2. WHEN parcel management is tested THEN the system SHALL cover CRUD operations, associations, calculations, and data integrity
3. WHEN product management is tested THEN the system SHALL cover catalog management, sales tracking, financial calculations, and status updates
4. WHEN dashboard features are tested THEN the system SHALL cover widget functionality, data visualization, customization, and responsive design
5. WHEN market analysis is tested THEN the system SHALL cover Vinted integration, data analysis, visualizations, and external API handling
6. WHEN statistics features are tested THEN the system SHALL cover ROI calculations, performance metrics, export functionality, and data accuracy
7. WHEN import/export features are tested THEN the system SHALL cover data validation, format handling, synchronization, and error recovery
8. WHEN administration features are tested THEN the system SHALL cover data exploration, monitoring, maintenance scripts, and system health
9. WHEN search and navigation are tested THEN the system SHALL cover global search, filtering, navigation flows, and user experience
10. WHEN UI components are tested THEN the system SHALL cover theming, responsiveness, accessibility, and interactive elements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration testing between frontend and backend components, so that I can ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user workflows are tested THEN the system SHALL validate complete user journeys from UI interaction to data persistence
2. WHEN API integrations are tested THEN the system SHALL verify data flow between frontend components and backend services
3. WHEN external service integrations are tested THEN the system SHALL validate Vinted API interactions, error handling, and data synchronization
4. WHEN real-time features are tested THEN the system SHALL verify WebSocket connections, live updates, and state synchronization
5. WHEN cross-browser compatibility is tested THEN the system SHALL validate functionality across different browsers and devices

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and load testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the system performs well under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization
2. WHEN load tests execute THEN the system SHALL simulate concurrent users and validate system stability
3. WHEN stress tests run THEN the system SHALL identify breaking points and failure modes
4. WHEN database performance is tested THEN the system SHALL validate query performance, connection pooling, and transaction handling
5. WHEN frontend performance is tested THEN the system SHALL measure page load times, rendering performance, and user interaction responsiveness
